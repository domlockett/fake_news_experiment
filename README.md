# Fake News Experiment

## Goals
The primary goal of this project was to examine the effects of exposure to "fake news" on political beliefs and participation. Specifically, the research aimed to understand how untrustworthy news websites influence political attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.

## Design
The study employed both observational and experimental methods:
- **Observational Data:** Collected consensual web browsing histories from three nationally representative samples to identify consumption of untrustworthy websites.
- **Experimental Data:** Conducted controlled experiments exposing participants to politically biased false stories or neutral stories and surveying their perceptions.

#### `replication_materials/misinfo-review_public.rmd`
The `misinfo-review_public.rmd` file contains the RMarkdown script used for analysis. This script details the steps taken to load data, perform statistical analyses, and generate visualizations.
- **Data Loading:** Data from the survey is loaded for analysis using the `readr` and `dplyr` packages.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Various statistical techniques are applied to analyze the impact of fake news on political behavior, including regression analysis and group comparisons. 
- **Visualization:** The script generates several plots to illustrate the findings, helping to understand the data distribution, relationships between variables, and the overall impact of fake news.
